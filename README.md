# Tawjihi-School-Records
in this Java desktop project I have created GUI as list of buttons that user can chose from.
The progress of the operation will be updated on a progress label.
I also made it read the two files .csv and divide them into 4 linkedLists based on area and branch of Tawjihi.
Because there will be only 4 probabilities of what the user is going to chose on radio buttons.
The operations "button" chosen will operate based on the 2 radio button user choices. 
And the program will report the mean, the mode, and the median, also the variance and standard devieation.
